						<h3>Project Description</h3>
						<p>This project was completed as my final year project of my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering. The goal was to develop a glove that could be used by rock-climbers and physical therapists to accurately measure the forces deployed in the tendons and other structures in the fingers of the hand.<br><br>Project details:
							<ul>
								<li>Completed in a team of 9</li>
								<li>Worked with a real client, with real deadlines and requests</li>
								<li>Took 1 year to complete</li>
								<li>Required multiple big deliverables and presentations</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>My contributions</h3>
						<p>Due to the size of this project, it involved a good amount of teamwork. My main contributions include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Designing all the PCBs and circuits with Eagle</li>
							<li>Developping the module capable of telling the angle of every phalanx on the hand(thumb excluded) in real-time using Arduino and Inertial Measurements Units (IMU)</li>
							<li>Helping develop a graphical user interface to show the data with QtCreator</li>
							<li>Leading and managing the weekly team meetings</li>
							<li>Leading the meetings with the Client</li>
							<li>Contributing to the redaction of official documentation and reviewing the whole documents for syntax, typos, and grammatical mistakes.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Following the end of the project, my peers designated me as the main leader of the team, and many told me they really enjoyed working with me because I contributed to creating a friendly, yet professional atmosphere</p>
