						<h3>Project Description</h3>
						<p>The physical design of a quadrotor drone is still a very complex task. This project aimed to find a good, reliable, and reproducible design method of a quadrotor in order to optimize a specific parameter (or multiple parameters), such as energy consumption. With this in mind, multiple optimization methods were compared.<br><br>This work was completed as part of a summer internship in the lab of Prof. Sofiane Achiche at Polytechnique Montreal, as part of a collaboration with the Royal Melbourne Institue of Technology in Australia.<br><br>
							<strong>An paper has recently been submitted to present the results of this work to IDETC-CIE.</strong><br><br><br>
							<strong>Technologies Used: </strong>Matlab/Simulink

						<h3>Methodology overview</h3>
						<p>The problem of finding the ideal parameters of a quadrotor drone was approached as an optimization problem, aiming to reduce energy consumption. Furthermore, two simulation methods were used. The first one used a typical MonteCarlo simulation. The second one used fuzzy numbers and fuzzy logic. A sensitivity analysis was then used on both models in order to compare the effect of every parameter on the results.</p>
