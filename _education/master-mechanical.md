  <p>After graduating in E.E., I decided to specialize in robotics with a professor I had been working with for over 3 years, Prof. Sofiane Achiche.</p>
  <p>After completing all the classes required for my M.Sc (artificial intelligence, computer vision, controls, etc.), I ended up with a <strong>4.00/4.00 GPA </strong></p><br><br>
  <p>My project was to develop an autonomous feeding system for people with disabilities using the MICO arm by Kinova. The main tasks consisted of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementing a food detection algorithm with Tensorflow &amp; Python to classify and locate food in the 3D workspace</li>
    <li>Setup-ing a ROS environment for simulation and control. This environment is now the baseline used in the lab.</li>
    <li>Developping an intuitive and robust way of sending commands for people with limited movement</li>
  </ul>
