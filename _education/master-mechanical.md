  <p>After graduating in E.E., I decided to specialize in robotics with a professor I had been working with for over 3 years, Prof. Sofiane Achiche.</p>
  <p>MY focus was on artificial intelligence, computer vision, and control systems. <strong>GPA: 4.00/4.00</strong></p><br><br>
  <p>My project was to develop an autonomous feeding system for people with disabilities using the MICO arm by Kinova. The main tasks consisted of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementing a food detection algorithm with Tensorflow &amp; Python to classify and locate food in the 3D workspace. Combines Faster RCNN with Intel stereo camera for depth estimation.</li>
    <li>Setup-ing a ROS environment for simulation and control. This environment is now the baseline used in the lab.</li>
    <li>Path-planning & Obstacle Avoidance of a 6DoF robot arm. Implemented using MoveIt! and OMPL libraries, as well as octomaps for 3D environment mapping.</li>
    <li>Developping an intuitive and robust way of sending commands for people with limited movement</li>
  </ul>
