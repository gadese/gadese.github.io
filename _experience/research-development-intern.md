  <p>Intern at Nuance Communications. My role for this internship was to contribute to the development of a proof of concept for Nuance's new computer vision projects. I worked on implementing state-of-the-art skeleton-based human pose recognition methods, as well as developping a method for human head pose estimation. For this project, I had to go through the whole design methodology for a deep learning problem: literature review, data annotation, data augmentation, implementation, transfer learning, debugging, optimization and development with HPC.</p>
