  <p>The main goal of this student club is to complete a different innovative project every year. In my first year, the goal was to build a human-like robot arm and hand. The hand designed was only missing 3 of the human's hand Degrees of Freedom (DoF). In my second year, I had to work on the design of an interactive control system for the robotic hand. The prototype used a sensory glove using fiber optic in order to follow the hand's movements. In my third and fourth years, we worked on designing an intelligent system capable of monitoring the electricity usage in a standard home.<br><br>Additionally, I had the opportunity to fill a more administrative role in PolyProject.</p>
