  <p>AI Scientist at Vooban, specializing in applied AI consulting. Responsible for end-to-end delivery of AI solutions. Includes feasibility studies, solution design, development and production deployment. Areas of work cover computer vision, audio processing, LLM/VLMs, NLP, generative AI, and recommender systems, with a strong emphasis on building client-ready products.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Contributions</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AI development:</strong> Built and deployed models for object detection/segmentation, text-voice alignment, voice isolation, LLMs/VLMs, OCR, and recommender systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Full-stack AI pipelines:</strong> Designed workflows covering data collection, annotation, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment.</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture &amp; planning:</strong> Defined project architectures, estimated resources (Jira), and led feasibility assessments with clients.</li>
    <li><strong>Production integration:</strong> Integrated research prototypes into production codebases, wrote documentation and technical guides.</li>
    <li><strong>Training &amp; outreach:</strong> Delivered workshops and conferences on Ethical &amp; Responsible AI for diverse audiences (entrepreneurs, developers, marketing teams).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Example projects</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Detection assistance for dubbing projects:</strong> Using a mix of audio processing, voice recognition, computer vision and traditional phoneme theory, detect several relevant elements of movies to assist with automated dubbing workflows, reducing manual editing time by 50%.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic takeoff of steel structures from architectural drawings:</strong> Using computer vision and OCR techniques to automatically extract measurements and quantities from blueprints.</li>
    <li><strong>Donator probability estimation:</strong> Using traditional machine learning and statistical models to predict donation likelihood from client data.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic countertop submission form extraction:</strong> Using computer vision, OCR and form parsing techniques to automatically extract data from submission forms, accelerating data entry.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic X-Ray auto part defect detection:</strong> Using object detection models to identify defects in automotive parts from X-ray images. Focusing on optimizing recall to reduce false negatives in quality control.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Tools &amp; Technologies</strong><br><em>AI-related:</em> Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, scikit-learn, OpenCV, pydantic-ai, LLM/VLM, Roboflow, MLFlow, Windsurf & other coding assistants, prompt engineering.<br><em>General programming:</em> Git, Docker, MacOS.<br><em>Generic skills:</em> project scoping, client communication, technical writing, workshop facilitation, multi-disciplinary collaboration, agile development, version control, re-inventing programming with agents in the loop.</p>
