  <p>Research Scientist at Nuance Communications. My role is to contribute to the improvement of Nuance's NLP solutions, particularly for chatbots. My main contributions include optimizing parameters to improve performance, as well as helping to maintain and update codebases. <br><br> In particular, most of my work has been on improving model performance on very small training sets without altering the model architecture. In short, I am looking at different techniques (simple data augmentation, complex data augmentation using generative models, Adversarial Training, Few-shot Learning, etc.).</p>
