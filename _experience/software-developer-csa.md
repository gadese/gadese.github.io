  <p>Software Developer at the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) through the Engineering Development Program. Spear-headed the agency's AI initiative—defining strategic priorities, recommending hardware, and proposing exploration projects to grow AI expertise across the organization. Worked at the intersection of robotics, deep learning, and systems engineering, with a focus on adapting modern AI techniques to the unique constraints of space environments.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Projects</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rover autonomy:</strong> Developed vision and path-planning algorithms for test rovers under strict compute budgets using ROS.</li>
    <li><strong>Radiation resilience:</strong> Investigated how space phenomena (radiation, bit flips) degrade neural network performance and explored mitigation strategies.</li>
    <li><strong>Low-light imaging:</strong> Prototyped deep-learning pipelines to correct extreme low-light satellite and rover imagery.</li>
    <li><strong>ISS science reviews:</strong> Provided technical oversight for science payloads destined for the International Space Station.</li>
    <li><strong>Hardware test automation:</strong> Built Python tools (GUI + protocols) to streamline stress testing of electrical components.</li>
    <li><strong>Satellite data processing:</strong> Acquired and processed high-resolution imagery and time-series data from multiple satellite sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Contributed to the recruitment process</strong> by reviewing applications, creating interview questions, and participating in technical interviews for the next cohort of engineers.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication & leadership:</strong> Built introduction presentations on Object-Oriented Programming and Deep Learning for colleagues without programming backgrounds. Supervised university students on space related projects.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Tools &amp; Technologies</strong><br><em>AI-related:</em> Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, ROS, Gazebo, Multi-threading.<br><em>General programming:</em> Git, Linux, Docker, C++.<br><em>Generic skills:</em> systems engineering, technical writing, literature review, project management, communication & presentation (both technical and general public).</p>
