  <p>Intern at Analogic Canada. My role consisted of developping image analysis algorithms to detect defects in X-Ray detectors using Python, as well as to translate legacy C++ code to Python and vice-versa. Furthermore, I automated the approval process of an X-ray detector following test results to speed up production. I also participated in organizing and managing the project using Scrum, as well as Sprints with weekly team meetings.</p>
