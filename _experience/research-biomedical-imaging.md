  <p>After my first year of engineering, I had the opportunity to work at the Laboratory of Optical Diagnoses and Imagery (LODI) with Prof. Caroline Boudoux. My project consisted of designing a variable length reference arm for an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) system in order to reduce the noise in images without the use of slow software correction.</p>
